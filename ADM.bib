@article{Devasahay2017,
abstract = {BACKGROUND There is growing attention over the last few years about non-attendance in hospitals and its clinical and economic consequences. There have been several studies documenting the various aspects of non-attendance in hospitals. Project Predicting Appoint Misses (PAM) was started with the intention of being able to predict the type of patients that would not come for appointments after making bookings. METHODS Historic hospital appointment data merged with "distance from hospital" variable was used to run Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Recursive Partitioning to decide the contributing variables to missed appointments. RESULTS Variables that are "class", "time", "demographics" related have an effect on the target variable, however, prediction models may not perform effectively due to very subtle influence on the target variable. Previously assumed major contributors like "age", "distance" did not have a major effect on the target variable. CONCLUSIONS With the given data it will be very difficult to make any moderate/strong prediction of the Appointment misses. That being said with the help of the cut off we are able to capture all of the "appointment misses" in addition to also capturing the actualized appointments.},

@article{Glowacka2009,
abstract = {This paper considers the outpatient no-show problem faced by a rural free clinic located in the south-eastern United States. Using data mining and simulation techniques, we develop sequencing schemes for patients, in order to optimize a combination of performance measures used at the clinic. We utilize association rule mining (ARM) to build a model for predicting patient no-shows; and then use a set covering optimization method to derive three manageable sets of rules for patient sequencing. Simulation is used to determine the optimal number of patients and to evaluate the models. The ARM technique presented here results in significant improvements over models that do not employ rules, supporting the conjecture that, when dealing with noisy data such as in an outpatient clinic, extracting partial patterns, as is done by ARM, can be of significant value for simulation modelling.},

@article{Alaeddini2011,
abstract = {The number of no-shows has a significant impact on the revenue, cost and resource utilization for almost all healthcare systems. In this study we develop a hybrid probabilistic model based on logistic regression and empirical Bayesian inference to predict the probability of no-shows in real time using both general patient social and demographic information and individual clinical appointments attendance records. The model also considers the effect of appointment date and clinic type. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated based on a patient dataset from a VA medical center. Such an accurate prediction model can be used to enable a precise selective overbooking strategy to reduce the negative effect of no-shows and to fill appointment slots while maintaining short wait times.},
